title: "Chicago Dev Retreat"
excerpt: "Filmhub is a fully remote team, but we bring together the enginering team (and sometimes the whole company) regularly for a few days in one location. These Dev Retreats are a week of intense collaborative work - for once, we're all in the same room, helping, discussing and coding together, in person."

In the fast-paced world of engineering, where virtual collaborations often take precedence, the opportunity to come together as a team in person becomes a cherished and rejuvenating experience. This past weekend, our engineering team embarked on a journey to the vibrant city of Chicago, marking another chapter in our global rendezvous tradition.

Our team, hailing from different corners of the world, converges every 3-4 months in a new city or country. The list of our past meetups reads like a travelogue â€“ from the lively streets of Madrid and the financial hub of Frankfurt to the romantic ambiance of Paris and the sun-kissed shores of Cabo San Lucas. Each location serves as a unique backdrop to our shared goal of innovation and collaboration.

As we wrap up our time in Chicago, thoughts eagerly turn to the next adventure awaiting us in Lisbon. The anticipation is palpable, and the prospect of discovering new cultures, cuisines, and workspaces fuels our excitement.

Working in person for a week may seem like a luxury, but it's an investment in our team chemistry and relationships. Beyond the boardroom, the bonds forged during these face-to-face encounters are invaluable. Whether solving complex problems, brainstorming new ideas, or simply enjoying a cup of coffee together, the sense of camaraderie strengthens our ability to work seamlessly when we return to our respective locations.

One distinctive aspect of our trips is the blend of work and exploration. Embracing the local culture, we set up makeshift offices in different cafes and restaurants, immersing ourselves in the heartbeat of the city. Chicago, with its rich culinary landscape, treated us to a gastronomic adventure. From deep-dish pizza to gourmet hot dogs, our taste buds reveled in the diversity of flavors that this iconic city had to offer.

For me, these gatherings are not only an opportunity to collaborate professionally but also a chance to indulge in my passion for street photography. Chicago, with its stunning architecture and lively streets, provided the perfect canvas for my hobby. In this blog post, I'll share a glimpse of the city through my lens, capturing the essence of our time spent exploring and working in the Windy City.

Join me on this visual journey as we navigate the intersections of technology, teamwork, and the tantalizing tastes of Chicago. Our team's commitment to innovation and collaboration knows no boundaries, and each meeting becomes a testament to the power of shared experiences in building a stronger, more connected team.
