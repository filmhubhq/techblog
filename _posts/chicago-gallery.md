excerpt: "Filmhub is a fully remote team, but we bring together the enginering team (and sometimes the whole company) regularly for a few days in one location. These Dev Retreats are a week of intense collaborative work - for once, we're all in the same room, helping, discussing and coding together, in person."

Filmhub is a fully remote team, but we bring together the enginering team (and sometimes the whole company) regularly for a few days in one location. These Dev Retreats are a week of intense collaborative work - for once, we're all in the same room, helping, discussing and coding together, in person. Quite energizing. But we also get out and spend time together - dinners, sightseeing, and the occasional "team building" event like group cooking classes or beach volleyball games.

We usually travel to the city or region of one of our team members, who can give us local insight, be our "tour guide" - and help book the best restaurants in town!

We're just back from last week's retreat week in Chicago. I love street photography, and had some good opportunity to roam the streets (and alleys) and snap some pics. Here is a small collection. Hope you like it.
